When a child activity exits, it can call setResult(int) to return data to its parent. 
The child activity must always supply a result code, which can be the standard results RESULT_CANCELED, RESULT_OK, 
or any custom values starting at RESULT_FIRST_USER.
In addition, the child activity can optionally return an Intent object containing any additional data it wants.
The parent activity uses the onActivityResult(int, int, Intent) method, 
along with the integer identifier the parent activity originally supplied, to receive the information.

If a child activity fails for any reason, such as crashing, the parent activity receives a result with the code RESULT_CANCELED.


class MyActivity : Activity() {
    // ...

    override fun onKeyDown(keyCode: Int, event: KeyEvent?): Boolean {
        if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER) {
            // When the user center presses, let them pick a contact.
            startActivityForResult(
                    Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK,Uri.parse("content://contacts")),
                    PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST)
            return true
        }
        return false
    }

    override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, intent: Intent?) {
        when (requestCode) {
            PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST ->
                if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
                    startActivity(Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, intent?.data))
                }
        }
    }

    companion object {
        internal val PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST = 0
    }
}
